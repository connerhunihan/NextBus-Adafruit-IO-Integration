# NextBus API Integration with AdafruitIO Dashboard
This program sends data from the NextBus API (https://gist.github.com/grantland/7cf4097dd9cdf0dfed14) into an Adafruit IO dashboard, which can then be used by an Arduino setup (https://github.com/connerhunihan/NextBus-AdafruitIO-Arduino-Integration) to create a light display that countdowns the minutes until your next bus arrives. 

## Prerequisites
